    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team1[0] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team1)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain1 = person
    captain1.age = 60

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 40 })

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      ...person,
